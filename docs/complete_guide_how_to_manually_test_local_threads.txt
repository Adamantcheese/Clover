Test on a board that does not have an archives support (like /b/).
1.1 Open the last thread in the catalog and press download button. (Test with both enabled and disabled pin and background pin watchers, foreground pin watcher should have the same behavior as )
	- If a thread is already 404ed do the same for another, not yet 404ed thread. 
	- Wait until it is fully downloaded (look in the logs).
	- Make sure that the download button is in "fully downloaded state" (no animation is playing) for both the drawer and the view thread controller.
	- Make sure that the thread status is set to "Local Thread".
	- Make sure that both "View local version" and "View live version" menus are disabled.
	- Make sure that there is no "archived" icon in the drawer for this pin.

1.2 Open the last thread in the catalog and press download button, then swiftly switch to the local thread via "View local version" menu. (Test with both enabled and disabled pin and background pin watchers)
	- If a thread is already 404ed do the same for another, not yet 404ed thread. 
	- Make sure that the thread status is set to "Local Thread".
	- There may be 404 pictures (since they shouldn't be all downloaded at this point).
	- Make sure that the thread status has "Loading in XXX" string (only for threads that are still being downloaded).
	- Wait until it is fully downloaded (look in the logs).
	- Make sure that it's still the "Local thread" and that there is no "Loading in XXX" string.
	- Make sure that the download button is in "fully downloaded state" (no animation is playing) for both the drawer and the view thread controller.
	- Make sure that there is no "archived" icon in the drawer for this pin.

For both:
	- Make sure that clicking the download button removes the pin from the pins list as well as the thread's file from the disk and the DB.
	- Make sure that clicking the download button again starts the thread downloading (but without images this time). This download is kinda bugged right now so it won't stop until you reload this thread. (But the thread should become a "Local thread" after reloading).
	- Make sure that when we have no internet connection (turn on the "Airplane mode") and we have a thread being downloaded we can switch to the local thread and back to the live thread (which will give us network error) without any problems (The download icon should be in "Downloading" state). When turning the "Airplane mode" back off make sure that we are still downloading the thread and can switch easily between the local and the live versions.
	- Make sure that when we have no WiFi connection (Turn the WiFi off) and the settings are not allowing us to download images they are not being downloaded. Make sure that the images are being downloaded when switching the WiFi back on. Make sure that both "View local version" and "View live version" menus are disabled.

Test on a board that does supports archives (like /g/).
	Pretty much the same as above but make sure that when a thread gets archived there is an "archive" icon in the Drawer near the pin.
