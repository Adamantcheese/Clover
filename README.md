# Clover4 - imageboard browser for Android  
[APK releases](https://github.com/Adamantcheese/Clover4/releases)

Clover4 is a fast Android app for browsing imageboards, such as 4chan and 8chan. It adds inline replying, thread watching, notifications, themes, pass support, filters and a whole lot more. It is based on Clover by Floens, but has additional features added in because Floens doesn't want to merge PRs. Credits to K1rakishou for a number of features.
