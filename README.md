# Kuroba - imageboard browser for Android  
[APK releases](https://github.com/Adamantcheese/Kuroba/releases)

Kuroba is a fast Android app for browsing imageboards, such as 4chan and 8chan. It adds inline replying, thread watching, notifications, themes, pass support, filters and a whole lot more. It is based on Clover by Floens, but has additional features added in because Floens doesn't want to merge PRs. 
Big thanks to Adamantcheese for maintaining the project up until now.
